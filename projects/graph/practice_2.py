# Print out all of the strings in the following array in alphabetical order sorted by the middle letter of each string, each on a separate line. If the word has an even number of letters, choose the later letter, i.e. the one closer to the end of the string.
# ['Waltz', 'Tango', 'Viennese Waltz', 'Foxtrot', 'Cha Cha', 'Samba', 'Rumba', 'Paso Doble', 'Jive']
# The expected output is:
# 'Cha Cha'
# 'Paso Doble'
# 'Viennese Waltz'
# 'Waltz'
# 'Samba'
# 'Rumba'
# 'Tango'
# 'Foxtrot'
# 'Jive'
